## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Nice styling.
* Your image is overlaying text in your layout because you have it set to position: absolute.  Be careful about your styles not being applied too widely!
* I want a little bit more information about Stan.  Specifically, it should at least have some information about what kind of technology he uses and his frustrations.
* Your code indentation needs work.  You should only indent after you open a new tag, not before.
* Your git commits are good, but could stand to be a little smaller.

Overall, this is a good project.  The image is an issue, but you write code that validates cleanly and reads easily.  Nice work.  Early submission helped you gain a grade here, so well done.

**Grade: Tier IV**

## Milestone 2 Feedback
* Once again, the styling here is very effective.
* I'm not sure about right aligned text.  It's fairly difficult to read.
* When I look at the site, I get a scrollbar because the image appears to be too far to the right.  Make sure you are testing across multiple screen sizes.
* I'd strongly suggest not going with an iFrame.  They are nightmares for accessibility and responsiveness.  Instead, just let text and CSS do the lifting here.
* In general on wireframes, don't use actual pictures, and when you are using text, use Lorem Ipsum rather than things that look like pictures.  Wireframes are more about layout, and getting pictures on there can actually be too restrictive when it comes time to build the site.
* "Send me a message" should have some kind of image that looks like a form that lays out what the look will be.
* Validation comes out cleanly, and your git commit history is good.

Overall, you should be a little bit more specific with your content, and a little bit less specific with your pictures.  There's a "just right" amount of detail that goes in a wireframe that will show stakeholders what a site will be, but leave the details up to you to flesh out later.  You're jumping the gun a bit to the design phase already, which should wait until later. 

The technical details of this project are good.  I think that this will make a good PWP.  When you get to the actual CSS, you'll get to put those visual design skills to work in a very positive way.

**This milestone grades out at a Tier III**

## Milestone 4 feedback
Looks good! Design follows the intended content strategy. Very solid git hygiene. No apparent issues with rendering. Submitted on time/early. This passes Tier IV.
