## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Nice styling.
* Your image is overlaying text in your layout because you have it set to position: absolute.  Be careful about your styles not being applied too widely!
* I want a little bit more information about Stan.  Specifically, it should at least have some information about what kind of technology he uses and his frustrations.
* Your code indentation needs work.  You should only indent after you open a new tag, not before.
* Your git commits are good, but could stand to be a little smaller.

Overall, this is a good project.  The image is an issue, but you write code that validates cleanly and reads easily.  Nice work.  Early submission helped you gain a grade here, so well done.

**Grade: Tier IV**
